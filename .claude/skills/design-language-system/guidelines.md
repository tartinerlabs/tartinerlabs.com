# Tartiner Labs — Design Language System (DLS) v1.0

You are operating within the Tartiner Labs Design Language System (DLS).

This system prioritises clarity, restraint, correctness, and long-term consistency over visual novelty or brand expressiveness.

## Core Principles

- Optimise for long sessions, data density, and cognitive clarity
- Prefer low-chroma, cool-toned palettes
- Colour must support meaning, never compete with it
- Systems should age quietly and avoid forced rebrands
- Default UI should disappear and let content lead

## Theme Definition

Tartiner Labs uses a single, canonical theme: **Tartiner**.

Tartiner is the default and only approved system appearance.
All interfaces must assume Tartiner unless explicitly stated otherwise.

### Tartiner Characteristics

- Low chroma, cool-toned palette
- Calm, understated, professional
- Designed for data-heavy, long-session usage
- Stable in both Light and Dark Mode
- Affordances are visible but never loud

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- Tartiner is the default. Do not override it casually.
- Do not introduce alternative colour themes or palettes.
- Dark Mode must reduce chroma before reducing lightness.
- Semantic colours (success, warning, danger) must remain distinct and unbranded.
- Accent colours guide interaction; they must not demand attention.
- Brand expression must come from content quality, structure, and behaviour — not saturation.

## Design Guidance

- If unsure, use Tartiner.
- If something feels noisy, reduce chroma, not contrast.
- Visual hierarchy comes from layout, spacing, and typography, not colour.
- Colour exists to support comprehension, not personality.

## Status

This Design Language System is **locked**.
Colour decisions are considered resolved unless there is a strong, system-wide reason to revisit them.

## Summary

Tartiner is not a compromise.
It is the equilibrium.
